This project is an object detection model built using Python and TensorFlow, developed within an Anaconda environment. It utilizes OpenCV for image and video processing, allowing for real-time object detection from both static images and live webcam feeds. The model architecture leverages TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities to identify and classify objects with high accuracy. NumPy and Matplotlib were used for numerical operations and visualizations, respectively. All dependencies are managed through Conda and pip, making setup and execution seamless. This project showcases my experience in computer vision, machine learning, and environment management, and serves as a foundation for further development in intelligent perception systems.
